These articles are mainly written about computer science and technology related topics. Some of these articles were written in my spare time. Others have been published for the Section Engineering Education program: https://www.section.io/engineering-education/authors/nimra-aftab/

### About Me
I'm a third year computer science student at University of Toronto. I often write for student audiences, and I am especially interested in creating computer science content for non-technical audiences. Feel free to visit my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimra-aftab
