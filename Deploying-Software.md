### Comparing On-premises and Cloud Deployment of Software
Many clients have difficulty deciding whether they should deploy their software on-site, or through a cloud computing service. On-premises deployment means that
the customer provides their own server for the software. Cloud deployment implies there is a third-party service involved. They provide the servers remotely and are
responsible for maintaining backed-up data.
#### Evaluating costs
On-premises deployment has a significant up-front cost. You are responsible for purchasing, installing, and maintaining hardware for your server. However, once the
initial costs are paid off, on-premises deployment can save you money over a long period of time. In contrast, cloud services are prepaid or subscription based. The
initial costs are budget friendly, but they can increase overtime.
#### Responding to security risks
Security is a major concern when deploying software. Setting up a computer program on-premises has a major benefit: you're not impacted when there is a security
breach at a third-party company. Since you are responsible for keeping your servers secure, you need to be aware of security protocols. Conversely, most cloud
companies have employees who specialize in dealing with security threats. These companies are better equipped at handling security because they have more
human resources.
#### Selecting a deployment method
Customers should carefully consider their organizationâ€™s needs before picking on-premises or cloud deployment. Selecting the best mode of deployment lets you
successfully use and maintain the software throughout your career.
